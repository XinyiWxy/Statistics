a simple simulation code that runs the dice rolls and prints out the probabilities of each remainder modulo 6 as plain text
What this does:
Runs 1,000,000 simulations of rolling six dice and summing.
Calculates sum modulo 6.
Counts how often each remainder (0 through 5) appears.
Prints the probability alongside a simple text-based bar (using *) scaled to probability.


import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)

num_trials = 1_000_000  # number of experiments

# Simulate rolling 6 dice num_trials times
rolls = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=(num_trials, 6))

# Sum across each trial
sums = np.sum(rolls, axis=1)

# Compute modulo 6 of the sums
modulo_results = sums % 6

# Count frequencies of each remainder 0-5
counts = np.bincount(modulo_results, minlength=6)

# Compute probabilities
probs = counts / num_trials

# Print probabilities with a simple text bar visualization
for r in range(6):
    bar = '*' * int(probs[r] * 50)  # scale for visualization
    print(f"Remainder {r}: Probability â‰ˆ {probs[r]:.4f} {bar}")
